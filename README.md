# Kevin5K

**Kevin5K** is an open-source Couch-to-5 K training app written entirely in **SwiftUI**.  It guides runners through a 9-week interval plan with clear audio cues (ding + spoken prompts) while politely ducking any background audio (podcasts, music, etc.).  The goal is a distraction-free, pocket-friendly experience‚Äîstart the session, lock your phone, and run.
